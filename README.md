# About Me

I'm a computer person. I use she/they pronouns.

My website is [living.computer](https://living.computer/), feel free to check it out.

## Things I'm Pretty Good At

- Node.js (regular JavaScript, not TypeScript)
- Developing websites (HTML/CSS/JS, usually using nginx, Node.js, or Apache2)
- Unreal Engine
- C++ (though C is a bit of a handicap for me)
- SDL2

## Things I'm Trying to Get Better At

- Interface design (as opposed to just development)
- Larger-scale projects
- Cybersecurity
- Teamwork (unemployment makes this difficult)

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
