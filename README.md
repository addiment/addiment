# I make stuff.

My name is Addison, I'm an amateur software developer, musician, and gamer. Open-Source software is awesome, and I like to make my own sometimes.

I use she/her and they/them pronouns. If you really want to contact me, I'm sure you can find a way.

## Things I make

- Programs using Node.js (Regular JS, not TypeScript)
- Websites (HTML/CSS/JS, usually writing my own backend stack with Node)
- Projects using Unreal Engine (games, usually)
- Random utilities/games in SDL2

## Things I'm trying to get better at

- Large-scale projects (i.e. something more complex than a database API or chat app)
- Cybersecurity (primarily for protecting self-hosted servers)
- Teamwork (unemployment makes this difficult)
