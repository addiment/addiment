# I make stuff.

My name is Addison, I'm an amateur software developer, musician, and gamer. Open-Source software is awesome, and I like to make my own sometimes.

I use she/her and they/them pronouns. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions/inquiries.

I'm currently running & developing [living.computer](https://living.computer/), feel free to check it out.

## Things I make

- Programs using Node.js (regular JavaScript, not TypeScript)
- Websites (HTML/CSS/JS, usually writing my own backend stack with Node)
- Projects using Unreal Engine (games, usually)
- Random utilities/apps/games in SDL2

## Things I'm trying to get better at

- Large-scale projects (i.e. something more complex than a database API or chat app)
- Cybersecurity (primarily for protecting self-hosted servers)
- Teamwork (unemployment makes this difficult)
